<p>I keep coming back to this idea: what if we had better text input for
mobile devices?</p>
<p>With a little practice, anyone can get to 100 wpm typing on a
computer keyboard. Many can get much higher than that. And it’s not just
raw text input speed: the precision of a mouse and ubiquity of keyboard
shortcuts allow effortlessly editing already written.</p>
<p>By contrast, text input on phones is sluggish. Innovations like
autocorrect, swiping, and predictive text input help, but even the
fastest, mobile-native users struggle to get faster than 70 wpm.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Two standard deviation of users aged 10–19 as of 2019
(the fastest age group) were under 68 wpm in a study by <a
href="https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/typing37k/">Palin, et al</a>.
(Table 4.)<br />
<br />
</span></span> I top out around 50 wpm despite consistently beating 130
wpm on a desktop keyboard.</p>
<p>Toss in punctuation, remove autocorrect (it doesn’t know my variable
names), and replace a mouse cursor with a finger, and now editing
<strong>code</strong> on a phone is like breathing through a straw. It’s
easily to the point where simply composing a function body on a phone
takes 5–10 times longer than on a laptop.</p>
<p>We’ve built incredible general-purpose computing devices with
processing power to run circles around the big desktops I learned to
program on. But the way we interface with them locks them up as devices
for consumption, not creation.</p>
<p>My commute is about 30 minutes of either riding on or waiting for
transit… why do I not spend that time:</p>
<ul>
<li>taking notes on something I’m reading?</li>
<li>drafting a blog post?</li>
<li>fixing a failing unit test on my pull request?</li>
<li>reviewing my teammate’s code?</li>
<li>polishing that project brief?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s <strong>not</strong> because I can’t use my phone for these—I
have! I drafted this whole post in <a href="http://1writerapp.com">a
markdown app</a> on my phone. <a href="https://blink.sh">Blink Shell</a>
gives me a whole Linux environment to build code, even on iOS. <a
href="https://tailscale.com">Tailscale</a> lets me build a website at
home and access it anywhere. GitHub, Gmail, and Google Docs all have
mobile apps.</p>
<p>Rather, the reason I don’t is because it’s <strong>so
unsatisfying</strong>. The disconnect between my speed of thought and my
speed of action is grating, making it impossible to get into anything
resembling a flow state. Like a runner stuck on a crowded sidewalk, I’m
constantly frustrated by the sputtering pace of progress.</p>
<p>In the same way that the mouse and keyboard revolutionized desktop
computing, and the touch screen enabled mobile computing, I can’t stop
thinking about this:</p>
<p>… what if it didn’t matter that transit was slower than driving,
because you could just leave earlier and then work-from-phone?</p>
<p>… how many startups would be started on the back of a school bus if
programming were as frictionless as mobile gaming?</p>
<p>… what are we leaving on the table by raising a generation to think
of computing as consuming, not creating?</p>
<p>… what if the interface to the computer in my pocket was empowering
like the interface to the one on my lap?</p>
