<main>
<p>I’ve noticed that programmers really like to bury the lede. An easy
way to make technical writing stronger is to <strong>figure out the main
point, and then just say it</strong> (before anything else). All the
supporting information can come after. Why does this strengthen the
piece?</p>
<p><strong>Readers will find it easier to read.</strong> Readers won’t
have to store all your supporting evidence in a mental queue while
waiting for a point to be made. Instead, they’ll read the main point,
then check supporting evidence against that claim piece by piece (only
holding one piece of evidence in mind at a time).</p>
<p><strong>The piece will sound more authoritative.</strong> This falls
somewhat naturally out of the new structure—it’s a lot harder to use
weasel words to water down your main claims when they come first.</p>
<p><strong>Skimming the piece will be more effective.</strong> Skimming
becomes ineffective if the topic sentence is buried somewhere in a
paragraph, because skimmers will skip it.</p>
<p>A suggestion: go so far as to write the claims into section headers.
Sometimes, this is just a technique I use while drafting, and I’ll
change the section headers before publishing. But sometimes I’ll
actually keep those headings in the finished product. It’s nice because
headings have to be short: short headings imply short, focused claims,
which are strong claims. This doc isn’t long enough for section headers,
but I still did this for the title itself.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">I learned this technique from one of my college
professor’s “<a
href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~kayvonf/misc/cleartalktips.pdf">Tips
for Giving Clear Talks</a>” presentation. It’s worth a read, as a lot of
the tips work for long-form writing as well as presentations. (I have a
local recording of the talk I can share if you’d like more than just the
slides.)<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Another suggestion: before publishing, try bolding the topic sentence
in each paragraph. First, it’ll expose whether a paragraph’s main point
is buried at the bottom. But also, it’ll expose whether your topic
sentence is a succinct: if a paragraph’s main point isn’t succinct,
there will be bold all over the place and maybe even bold in multiple
places. Like with the previous tip, sometimes I’ll keep and sometimes
I’ll drop these bolded claims before publishing (as you can see
above).</p>
<p>Burying the lede manifests most frequently by programmers putting the
“Why” before the “What.” I have various theories why this is, but I
think it’s mostly because programmers feel like logical proofs need to
flow from assumptions to conclusions—that by introducing the claim first
and supporting it second, they’re not being rigorous. Another theory:
people think that they need to make their writing more entertaining by
making it “suspenseful.” Suspense rarely improves technical writing,
where the focus is on conveying facts quickly.</p>
<p>Here’s two common examples of putting why before what, and how
inverting things makes the writing stronger:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A “look at what I did” email that puts the “background” section
ahead of the “impact” section.</p>
<p>Unless you’re really good at narration (funny, clever, etc.), the
background is going to be more boring than the impact you’re announcing.
Leading with impact is the easiest tool you have in an email to wow the
reader and capture their attention. Once captivated, they’ll continue
with your background for more details, or decide that they don’t need
to.</p></li>
<li><p>A help doc structured like “Here’s something incorrect that you
could do you do. Here’s why it’s a problem. You need to do this
instead.”</p>
<p>Writing the claim first anchors all further examples on what to pay
attention to. Here’s an <a
href="https://sorbet.org/docs/attached-class#tattached_class-as-an-argument">example
in the Sorbet docs</a> about using <code>T.attached_class</code> in an
argument. Note how the first sentence is “you can’t do this, because of
soundness problems.” The alternative would be to dive into the bad
example immediately, leaving readers wondering what the final point will
eventually be.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t bury the lede. Instead, start by saying what you want to say,
and then follow up by supporting it. Your piece will sound stronger and
be more effective, and your readers will thank you.</p>
