<p>One thing I’ve had a lot of fun with is little hand-drawn diagrams to
help me explain things. Some examples:</p>
<p>→ <a href="https://blog.jez.io/sorbet-rescue-control-flow/">Sorbet’s
weird approach to exception handling</a><br />
→ <a href="https://blog.jez.io/gc-compact-in-pictures/">GC.compact in
Pictures</a><br />
→ <a
href="https://sorbet.run/talks/RubyConf2021/#/visualizing-api-latency-1">Compiling
Ruby to Native Code with Sorbet and LLVM</a></p>
<p>Here’s my workflow for drawing them:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I draw the diagrams with an Apple Pencil on a 12.9-inch iPad Pro
(2nd generation) that I bought new in 2017—it still runs as well as the
day I brought it home. It took a little time to get used to the feeling
of drawing with plastic-on-glass instead of ink-on-paper, but I find
that the super-low-latency of the screen helps a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>I simply use the default Notes app. I tried some other apps but
found that I kept coming back to Notes at the end of the day (I also use
Notes for random notes I need to jot down).</p></li>
<li><p>The text and lines are all free-form. I like the charm that it
adds to posts—I don’t want something super polished looking like you’d
get from another diagramming tool.</p></li>
<li><p>To export a finished diagram for use in a post, I lasso-select
the piece I want to export, copy it, and then switch to the Dropbox app
on my iPad.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Previously, I would paste the image into an iMessage
with myself, then hop over to a laptop to save it as a file.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Dropbox lets you save an image on the clipboard as a
file, and from there I can rename and move it wherever I need to.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/light/hand-drawn-lasso.png"
alt="A screenshot of the Notes app" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A screenshot of the Notes
app</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/dark/hand-drawn-lasso.png"
alt="A screenshot of the Notes app" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A screenshot of the Notes
app</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The images are transparent by default (which is nice) and the
lasso-select crops the export to the same size every time a selection is
made (important for the next step).</p></li>
<li><p>I really like that my blog has a high quality light <em>and</em>
dark theme—try toggling on your device!—but all that work goes away if
there’s a big white diagram on an otherwise dark-mode page.</p>
<p>The fun thing about drawing in Notes is that I get light and dark
versions of the diagrams for free. When I switch from light to dark mode
on my iPad, the Notes app re-renders all my drawings to use
dark-mode-friendly colors (for example, black lines become white
lines).</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like in practice:</p>
<div
style="position:relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
<p><iframe
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height:100%;"
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CJ1tHoDdlWE"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen> </iframe></p>
</div>
<p>As long as the light and dark mode images have the same cropping
(which they do, because of the the Notes lasso select) then the rendered
page will look the same in light or dark.</p></li>
<li><p>Once I have light and dark versions of both images, I have some
CSS on my blog that lets me just put the two directly adjacent in the
source, and one of them will get <code>display: none</code>. So this
Markdown:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode markdown"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Here&#39;s an example image:</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="al">![](/assets/img/light/example.png)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="al">![](/assets/img/dark/example.png)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>As you can see, ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and <a
href="https://github.com/jez/blog/blob/a5ccacacc0b38cfad79d6f08067dd09ba5ee8c7a/assets/css/extra.css#L1-L17">this
CSS</a> combine to show the relevant image and hide the other.</p>
<p>I like that it’s very light on additional markup in the
page.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s pretty much it 👌 It’s a bit clunky (it would be neat if I
could streamline or even automate the export flow), but it’s not that
bad. In any given post I’ll usually only have a two or three diagrams so
it’s not super toilsome, and adds a nice bit of charm.</p>
