<main>
<p>I’ve found it useful to search though the source code of things lower
in the stack lately. For example I saw an error something like this at
work recently:</p>
<pre><code>❯ rake test
symbol lookup error: /home/jez/.../foo.so: undefined symbol bar</code></pre>
<p>I was pretty confused. Modulo the names of commands and files, this
was pretty much all the output.</p>
<p>So I started searching. First I searched through my codebase for
<code>"symbol lookup error"</code>, but found nothing. Surely that
string exists somewhere. That must mean it’s coming from lower in the
stack?</p>
<p>The next level lower would mean third party Ruby gems. At work we use
Bundler <a
href="https://bundler.io/v2.0/guides/deploying.html#manual-deployment">in
a mode</a> where it installs all gems into a single convenient folder in
the current directory: <code>./vendor/bundle/</code>. But a search in
that folder turned up nothing again. So… further down?</p>
<p>If it’s not from the app, and not from the gems, then maybe it’s in
Ruby itself? I cloned the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby">Ruby
source</a>, checked out the <a
href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/v2_6_5">version tag</a> for the
Ruby version we’re running, and searched for
<code>"symbol lookup error"</code> once again. And again nothing!</p>
<p>There’s still plenty of layers below us, so let’s keep peeling them
back. Ruby is written in C, which means we should check libc next (the C
standard library). There are multiple libc implementations, but I was
running this on Linux, so let’s check GNU libc (glibc). glibc is <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/sources.html">isn’t on
GitHub</a>, but that’s not a huge deterrant. Here’s the search:</p>
<pre><code>❯ rg -t c &#39;symbol lookup error&#39;
dl-lookup.c
876:      _dl_signal_cexception (0, &amp;exception, N_(&quot;symbol lookup error&quot;));</code></pre>
<p>That’s a bit of a smoking gun! After all those layers, we found our
error message in libc itself. (This gave me a lot of leads on the
problem at hand, e.g., I had definitely ruled out a problem in my app or
its dependencies, and I was thinking, “probably something is wrong about
how <code>foo.so</code> was compiled.” There’s a fun story here about
how Ruby C extensions work, but that’s a <a
href="/linkers-ruby-c-exts/">tangent for another time</a>.)</p>
<p>My point is that <a
href="https://livegrep.com/search/linux">searching all the code</a> is a
super power, and it applies to more than just searching the code we’ve
written. What a blessing that the tools we’re building on, like Ruby and
GNU libc, are all open source!</p>
<p>The next time it looks like a problem is outside the scope of your
app’s code, maybe try searching the code:</p>
<ul>
<li>inside your gems or packages!</li>
<li>inside your language’s standard library!
<ul>
<li>Some IDEs will even let you jump-to-def into core libraries 😮</li>
</ul></li>
<li>inside your language’s runtime
<ul>
<li>(if you’re using a language with a runtime like Ruby or Python or
even <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8">JavaScript</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>powering your operating system kernel! <span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">This might sound daunting, but sometimes it can be
useful. A good thing to keep in mind: every <strong>system call</strong>
like <code>open(2)</code> or <code>write(2)</code> or
<code>select(2)</code> (and every other function from section 2 of the
man pages) is really just a way for your program to request that the
operating system do something; knowing that can be a decent place to
start traipsing through code in the operating system.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>For me, I’ve already noticed it help save me time and give me more
context when I’m debugging.</p>
