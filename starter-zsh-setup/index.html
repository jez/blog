<p>Zsh has given me so much mileage with respect to efficiency at the
command line. Looking back I’m a little sad I didn’t switch to it
sooner. One of the reasons why it took so long was that I didn’t know
where to start; with this in mind, I’ve collected some of the
zsh-specific bits of my dotfiles into one place to help people hit the
ground running.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>To cut to the chase, you can find my <a
href="https://github.com/jez/starter-zshrc">starter zshrc</a> on GitHub.
It contains usage information as well as loads of inline comments to
give you a line-by-line summary.</p>
<p>Note: it’s an <em>starter</em> zshrc. What I mean by this is that
it’s more of a skeleton. It’s been crafted with the assumption that
you’re coming from bash and you already have some bash config that
you’re weary to part with. The content here aims to be minimally
invasive, and since zsh is largely compatible with bash, the rest of
your config should fit right in.</p>
<h1 id="going-further">Going Further</h1>
<p>I have even more zsh-specific and general configuration nuggets in my
personal dotfiles, which are <a
href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles">also on GitHub</a>. I add to them
nearly every day, and I’m pretty fond of them if I do say so myself. You
might want to read <a
href="http://blog.jez.io/2015/03/10/noteworthy-dotfile-hacks/">Noteworthy
Dotfile Hacks</a> if you’re looking for a quick overview of some
snippets and features I’ve collected into my dotfiles.</p>
