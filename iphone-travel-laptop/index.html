<p>A while back I picked up a tiny, folding, wireless keyboard to turn
my phone into a passable laptop replacement when traveling (thanks to
some excellent apps and the power of SSH). It’s already incredible, and
only one or two features are missing from iOS which would make it really
amazing.</p>

</figure>
<p>I picked up this <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZLMG7SN/">wireless folding
keyboard</a> for $25 on Amazon. It’s only slight bigger than my phone
itself (iPhone 12) and manages to fit in my jeans front pocket.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/folding-keyboard-folded.jpg" /></p>
<p>For many of my personal trips, bringing a full-sized laptop or even
an iPad is overkill, especially if there’s only a 10% chance that I’ll
end up using it. When I do wish I had a laptop, it’s usually because I
want to do a little blogging or light programming.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">For example, the trip calls for nothing but day hiking,
but one day we get rained out. Or the trip calls for nothing but skiing,
but the first day I get injured.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Now, all I have to do is tuck this keyboard somewhere in
a carry-on.</p>
<p>It’s the software that makes this setup workable as a short-term
laptop replacement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At home, I have a computer running SSH.</p>
<p>It happens that it’s a desktop running Linux, but it could just as
easily be a laptop running macOS with Remote Login enabled in the system
settings.</p></li>
<li><p>I have <a href="https://tailscale.com">Tailscale</a> installed on
both my phone and the computer at home, filling the role of a VPN.</p>
<p>This lets my phone SSH to the computer while traveling without having
to deal with setting up port forwarding (and thus exposing the computer
to the public internet).</p></li>
<li><p>I have <a href="https://blink.sh">Blink Shell</a> installed on my
phone. Blink has a ton of features, but I basically only use it for the
terminal SSH client.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot of things I love about this setup:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have access to every (headless) program installed on my
computer.</p>
<p>I use Vim for blogging and programming, so I don’t need a graphical
text editor, <strong>but</strong> Blink <a
href="https://docs.blink.sh/advanced/code#starting-blink-code">embeds VS
Code</a> for those who don’t. Blink’s copy of VS Code allows remotely
editing files on any host that it can SSH into. I haven’t used it
extensively, but it works <em>shockingly</em> well from what I’ve
tried.</p></li>
<li><p>Tailscale gives me access to my blog preview.</p>
<p>Each device on a tailnet gets an IP address, so I can just point iOS
Safari at <code>&lt;computer-tailnet-ip&gt;:4000</code> and preview my
blog while I write.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Side benefit: I’m reading the mobile version of my post
while I write, making it less likely that the post looks bad on mobile
(due to something like a super long line of code or wordy
heading).<br />
<br />
</span></span></p></li>
<li><p>Blink pairs <strong>perfectly</strong> with AirPlay screen
mirroring.</p>
<p>With the Blink app open in iOS screen mirroring mode, Blink magically
uses the connected display as a full-resolution, non-mirrored external
display. It turns any random smart TV into a 4K external monitor.</p>
<!-- TODO(jez) picture of Blink on a TV -->
<p>Without AirPlay, Blink plus the iPhone in landscape mode is passable:
there’s plenty of horizontal space, but vertical space comes at a
premium.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">I can get a 107x21 terminal with my phone on my lap and
the text at a comfortable size. Plenty big enough for 80-character code
lines plus some space for line numbers, but tedious when four of the
rows are taken up with status lines and tab bars from Vim &amp;
Tmux.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-it-could-be-amazing">How it could be amazing</h2>
<p>It’s impressive how well it already works—I wrote this whole post
with just phone and keyboard while waiting in an airport terminal!<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">To get the images in the post, I have Dropbox on both
my phone and the home computer, and Image Magick to convert &amp; resize
the photos.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>But there’s a few things keeping this setup from being amazing.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For some reason, <code>Cmd-Tab</code> to switch to the most
recently used app is one of the few keyboard shortcuts that
<strong>doesn’t</strong> transfer from macOS. It’s crazy, because it
works on iPadOS.</p>
<p>This seems like an oversight? Surely someone at Apple could sneak
this into a future iOS update.</p>
<p>Right now, my workaround is to use <code>Cmd-Space</code> to bring up
“Siri Suggestions” (aka Spotlight-for-iOS) and type the name of the app
I want to switch to.</p></li>
<li><p>The input latency stacks up.</p>
<p>I haven’t isolated where the typing latency comes from, but I imagine
it’s smeared across lots of things (my top hunches right now are:
physical distance to the computer at home, lag in AirPlay screen
mirroring, and lag in the Blink terminal emulator).</p>
<p>I try to minimize how much the lag affects me by using lots of
keyboard shortcuts. I’ve included some of my favorites in the <a
href="#appendix-fun-keyboard-shortcuts">Appendix</a> below.</p></li>
<li><p>iOS Safari doesn’t do the “AirPlay screen mirroring is external
display” trick. If this worked, it would be absolutely
<strong>killer</strong>.</p>
<p>It makes sense that iOS Safari doesn’t magically become full-screen
by default—non power-users attempting to screen mirror would not expect
it.</p>
<p>But it would be incredible if an iPhone could drive a web browser at
a full 4K resolution. Given how many things are already possible to do
with nothing more than a desktop web browser, having one on my phone
would be huge.</p></li>
<li><p>Some apps only work in portrait mode.</p>
<p>Slack and the iOS Settings app are the two which don’t support
landscape that I find myself wanting to use the most with this travel
setup.</p>
<p>Slack is a double offender because it also doesn’t support
<em>any</em> keyboard shortcuts on iOS that the desktop app supports, as
far as I can tell.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="work-vs-personal">Work vs personal</h2>
<p>For light use cases, where I’m basically only blogging or writing
code in Vim and compiling at the terminal, this setup is great.</p>
<p>But I have a dream of one day being able to use this setup for
<strong>work trips</strong> too. Think of how cool it would be to travel
to an office in another city, sit down at any desk, plug in my phone
over USB-C and get to work. This is <em>almost</em> possible.</p>
<p>For me, the things holding it back are all related to where I work
(where we can’t connect our phones to the corporate VPN) and how
important Slack is for work trips (Slack doesn’t support iOS landscape
mode, let alone the magical Blink external display mode). It’s so close
to being a reality!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have one of the most powerful computers ever built in my pocket at
all times. It would be <strong>so cool</strong> if I use it like one,
and we’re so close to being there.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h2 id="appendix-fun-keyboard-shortcuts">Appendix: Fun keyboard
shortcuts</h2>
<p>Some of the keyboard shortcuts I noticed myself using the most while
writing this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS
<ul>
<li><code>Opt-Backspace</code> and <code>Cmd-Backspace</code>, which
delete the previous word or line.</li>
<li><code>Cmd-Space</code>, to bring up “Siri Suggestions” (which I only
use to launch apps).</li>
<li><code>Cmd-.</code>, which usually does whatever <code>Esc</code>
does on iOS.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Actually typing <code>Esc</code> on this keyboard
requires pressing <code>Shift-Fn-`</code> which I find harder.<br />
<br />
I don’t know the origin of <code>Cmd-.</code> acting like
<code>Esc</code> on macOS (and iOS by extension), but it’s right there
in the <a
href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/keyboards/">Human
Interface Guidelines</a>.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Safari
<ul>
<li><code>Cmd-L</code> to focus the address bar in Safari.</li>
<li><code>Cmd-T</code>/<code>Cmd-W</code> open and close tabs.</li>
<li><code>Cmd-Opt-Left</code>/<code>Cmd-Opt-Right</code> to go to the
previous/next tab.</li>
<li><code>Cmd-[</code>/<code>Cmd-]</code> to go to back and forward in a
tab’s history.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vim
<ul>
<li><code>Ctrl-W</code> and <code>Ctrl-U</code> in insert mode to delete
the previous word or line.</li>
<li><code>{</code>/<code>}</code> to move back/forward a paragraph.</li>
<li><code>[s</code>/<code>]s</code> to jump to the previous/next
spelling mistake (lots of typos on this small keyboard with the
lag).</li>
<li><code>z=1</code> (bound to <code>&lt;leader&gt;z</code>) to accept
the first suggested spelling correction.</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-[</code>, which is the same as <code>Esc</code> in
terminals.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Blink
<ul>
<li><code>Cmd-T</code>/<code>Cmd-W</code> open and close tabs.</li>
<li><code>Cmd-O</code> to toggle focus between the phone and the
external display in screen mirroring.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, I’ve had great success by blindly trying macOS keyboard
shortcuts and having them also work on iOS.</p>
