<p>I’ve been struggling to get the RSS version of my posts to look good
in the presence of all the features my blog supports (side notes, line
highlights on code blocks, light- and dark-mode images, etc.). With that
in mind, I’m switching to share only a link and a post summary in the
feed, omitting the full content.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>There were too many problems with the way posts rendered, and I
didn’t have the patience to continue working around the problems. The
way side notes render in a feed is particularly annoying:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/light/rss-side-note.jpg" class="center"
style="max-width: 390px;"
alt="Highlighted: what would normally appear as a sidenote" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Highlighted: what would normally appear
as a sidenote</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/dark/rss-side-note.jpg" class="center"
style="max-width: 390px;"
alt="Highlighted: what would normally appear as a sidenote" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Highlighted: what would normally appear
as a sidenote</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’ve taken this example from <a
href="/sorbet-rescue-control-flow/">this post</a>. In that post, the
side note appears in-line with a superscript number, and the paragraph
continues after the side note anchor. But because of the HTML markup I’m
using <a
href="https://jez.io/pandoc-markdown-css-theme/features/#side-notes-and-margin-notes">to
achieve that</a>, elements that ought to be hidden are not (in
particular, the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element).</p>
<p>A similar problem happens with light- and dark-mode images:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/light/rss-double-image.jpg" class="center"
style="max-width: 390px;"
alt="A feed reader showing both light and dark images" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A feed reader showing both light and dark
images</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/dark/rss-double-image.jpg" class="center"
style="max-width: 390px;"
alt="A feed reader showing both light and dark images" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A feed reader showing both light and dark
images</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Feed readers don’t use the CSS (admittedly, by design) to know that
one of the two versions of the images <a
href="/hand-drawn-diagrams/">will have <code>display: none</code></a>,
so it shows both. Because the dark-mode image uses white lines instead
of black lines, a lot of the lines in the drawing aren’t even visible,
making it hard to tell that the diagram is identical to the previous one
(modulo colors).</p>
<p>Another gripe was that code blocks on my site support highlighting
individual lines, <a
href="https://blog.jez.io/syntactic-control-flow/#cb2-25">like this</a>.
Those get dropped by feed readers, stripping the context from any
explanation that says “look at the highlighted lines.”</p>
<p>And another gripe was that the way I render the table of contents was
making it look like the navigation elements on the page were part of the
post content. Every post’s preview in a feed reader always looked the
same, starting with text like “← Return home” or “Home Contents…”,
instead of the actual intro of the post.</p>
<p>After spending some time, it ended up being more effort than I wanted
to spend to render a post differently for the blog view or the feed
view. I could have left it quirks and all, but I’d rather encourage
people to read the posts on the web where they’ll be typeset as intended
(especially considering that my blog theme is quite responsive at all
screen sizes). Sorry for any inconveniences!</p>
