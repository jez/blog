<p>This is the fourth post in a series about “things I’ve learned while
making improvements to Sorbet’s parser.” With the last post, I talked
about some tools and techniques that I’ve found useful while hacking on
Sorbet’s <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">Bison</a>-based
parser. This post is going to continue that theme by explaining in a
little more detail the primary tool Bison has for adding error recovery
to a parser: the special <code>error</code> token.</p>

</ul>
<p>That being said, if you’re also trying to hack on a Bison parser to
make it recover from errors, I hate to say it but this post is not going
to be a substitute for the <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html#Error-Recovery">official
docs on Error Recovery</a>. You’re going to want to spend some time
skimming that section of the docs if you haven’t already.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Bison needs explicit annotations within a grammar to provide syntax
error recovery. This is in contrast with parser tools like <a
href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">tree-sitter</a>,<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">If you’re curious, I’ve written some assorted <a
href="/categories/#tree-sitter">thoughts on tree-sitter</a>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> which automatically include error recovery. Concretely,
Bison requires inserting special <code>error</code> tokens in production
rules that should participate in error recovery.</p>
<p>To get the most out of Bison’s error recovery mode, it’s crucial to
understand what it’s actually doing with those <code>error</code>
tokens.</p>
<h1 id="bisons-error-recovery-algorithm">Bison’s error recovery
algorithm</h1>
<p>There’s a vague description of the algorithm <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html#Error-Recovery">in
the docs</a>, but I found that I had to make the algorithm more explicit
before I could understand what was and wasn’t possible.</p>
<p>At a high level, this is what Bison does:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It encounters an error. By which we mean: neither shifting the
lookahead token nor reducing the current stack is a valid action given
the current lookahead token).</p></li>
<li><p>It reports the error by calling the (user-defined)
<code>yyerror</code><span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">In C++ parsers, this is called
<code>parser::error</code>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> function.</p>
<p>Importantly, this function is <strong>always</strong> called.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Other parser generators, for example <a
href="https://www.haskell.org/happy/">Happy</a> for Haskell do not
necessarily report an error when an <code>error</code> token is
produced.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Even if a production rule eventually consumes the error
token and successfully recovers from the parse error, an error will have
been reported.</p>
<p>Also note that it’s impossible<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Sorbet gets around this limitation by appending parse
errors to a temporary queue, only flushing them to the user once parsing
has completed. Sorbet sometimes <a
href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/blob/e961ac4ee7c4e425e5b5f14a03b7ce20c3bdbbc2/parser/parser/cc/grammars/typedruby.ypp#L1976-L1981">mutates</a>
the last element of the queue inside semantic actions to improve the
error message with specific information about the parse failure.<br />
<br />
</span></span> to delay calling <code>yyerror</code> until it’s clear
that no production rule matched the <code>error</code> token, since the
<code>yyerror</code> function is called even before attempting to
<strong>shift</strong> the <code>error</code> token, less reduce a rule
that uses it. For similar reasons, this makes it more complicated to
allow the eventual error rule to provide extra context on the error
message.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, Bison looks to see it can shift the <code>error</code>
token, given what the current stack contents and parser state are. It
leaves the current lookahead token untouched for the time being.</p>
<p>If it can shift the <code>error</code> token, it does so. Bison has
finished recovering from the syntax error. The parse continues, using
the untouched lookahead token.</p></li>
<li><p>If it <strong>can’t</strong> shift the <code>error</code> token,
Bison <strong>completely discards</strong> the object on the top of the
stack.</p>
<p>To make that clear, if the parser stack looked something like
this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># def foo</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">#   x.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># end</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>stack <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="kw">[</span><span class="vs">&#39;def&#39;</span>, identifier, <span class="ch">&#39;\n&#39;</span>, expression, <span class="ch">&#39;.&#39;</span><span class="kw">]</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>lookahead <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="vs">&#39;end&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and Bison found no matching error production rule, it would throw
away the <code>'.'</code> token that it had already shifted onto the
parser stack:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>stack <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="kw">[</span><span class="vs">&#39;def&#39;</span>, identifier, <span class="ch">&#39;\n&#39;</span>, expression<span class="kw">]</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>lookahead <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="vs">&#39;end&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then loop back to the previous step, checking to see whether it’s
now possible to shift the <code>error</code> token. This process repeats
until Bison has gobbled up the whole stack or some production rule
consumes the error token.</p></li>
<li><p>If Bison’s <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html#Tracking-Locations">Location
Tracking</a> feature is on (which allows using <code>@1</code>,
<code>@2</code>, etc. in semantic actions to get the locations
associated with components of the rule), it’s worth knowing how the
<code>error</code> token’s location is set. Bison sets the error
location to span from the last thing it discarded from the stack all the
way to the lookahead token that induced the error. If it discarded
nothing, then the range would just be the location of the lookahead
token.</p>
<p>Using the example above, if the <code>'.'</code> token was the only
token Bison needed to discard, the error token’s location would be set
to span from that <code>'.'</code> token all the way to the
<code>'end'</code> lookahead token.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Most Bison grammars have a catch all <code>| error</code> production
somewhere, like this one in Sorbet’s parser:</p>

<p>The nice thing about a rule like this is that it provides coarse
grained error recovery at a high level without requiring special cases
for every production in the grammar. It works because no matter what
happens to be on the stack, it’ll always eventually match (as long as
we’re in the parser state corresponding to <code>stmts</code>) because
eventually Bison will have discarded the entire stack.</p>
<p>It’ll definitely throw away a lot of stuff, but at least it’ll let
the parse continue instead of failing to produce any parse result. For
example, if there was no parse error further down in the file, and the
error occurred near the top, this rule gets us lots of error recovery
for little work. But yeah, it’s not great to throw that much stuff
away.</p>
<p>We’re going to want to put more <code>error</code> tokens in more
targeted places. For that, I’ve come up with a handful of strategies to
make the most of Bison’s error recovery.</p>
<h1 id="figure-out-the-most-common-edit-paths">Figure out the most
common edit paths</h1>
<p>Even though Bison requires a lot of <code>error</code> annotations to
get good parse results, you can get good bang for your buck by figuring
out the most common edit paths. For example, here’s every intermediate
edit when the user adds a keyword argument to a Ruby method:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>foo(a, <span class="wa">x: </span>x) <span class="co"># contents before edit</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>foo(a, <span class="wa">x: </span>x,)</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>foo(a, <span class="wa">x: </span>x, y)</span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>foo(a, <span class="wa">x: </span>x, y:)</span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>foo(a, <span class="wa">x: </span>x, <span class="wa">y: </span>y) <span class="co"># edit finished</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Ideally there’s an <code>error</code> production for every
intermediate state, because adding a keyword argument to a method call
is common. On the other hand, you can likely get away not adding rules
for uncommon syntax errors.</p>
<p>If you want, you can take the guesswork out of what’s common and
what’s not by measuring, assuming you have a corpus of syntax errors you
can sample from.<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">For example, we gather usage metrics from every Sorbet
user at Stripe.<br />
<br />
</span></span> The semi-automated approach to measurement, which is what
I’ve personally used: when there’s a syntax error and the parse result
is “bad” according to some heuristic (like: the parse is completely
empty, or there was a partial parse result but it was too bad to find
any completion suggestions at the user’s cursor), log the bad source
buffer to a file, and then go triage the logged files, fixing the most
common errors first.</p>
<p>The annoying part about that approach is the manual triage work of
opening up the logged buffers, identifying which part of the file had
the parse error, and blaming it to some section of the parser. An idea
I’ve had (but not implemented) for a more automatic approach: when
there’s a syntax error that’s never recovered (or that’s handled by some
“catch all” production rule), log the lookahead token and parser state
where the error happened. Cross reference parser states with what’s in
the <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html#Understanding">textual
report</a> on the parser to get approximate line numbers in the grammar
that need to be updated. States that show up the most commonly are the
ones in need of dedicated <code>error</code> rules.</p>
<h1 id="the-error-token-is-usually-last">The <code>error</code> token is
usually last</h1>
<p>With the most common edit paths in hand, I’ve usually had the most
success by following two tips for crafting the error rules.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Put the <code>error</code> token as the very last token in the
production rule. It can be tempting to try writing rules like this,
where the <code>error</code> token is followed by some other stuff:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode yacc"><code class="sourceCode yacc"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  | args &#39;,&#39; arg { <span class="co">/* ... */</span> }</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  | args &#39;,&#39; error arg  { <span class="co">/* ... */</span> }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Sometimes this works, but in my experience, it’s much easier to
reason about conflicts when the <code>error</code> token is the last
token in a rule.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the <code>error</code> token <strong>only</strong> after
terminals. There’s almost never conflicts in the grammar when putting
the <code>error</code> token after a <code>','</code> or
<code>'='</code> token, but there usually are when putting it after
something like an <code>args</code> non-terminal.</p>
<p>Intuitively this makes sense, because the <code>args</code>
production itself probably has a bunch of rules that have consume an
<code>error</code> token at the end, causing the conflicts. The
non-terminal might even have a catch-all <code>| error</code>
rule.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In situations where I haven’t been able to trivially follow these
rules, I’ve usually been able to go into the preceding non-terminal rule
(like <code>args</code>) and sprinkle <code>error</code> tokens
judiciously inside <em>that</em> rule to allow following these
rules.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there have definitely been times where that hasn’t
worked, which will be the topic of a future post.
<!-- TODO(jez) Link to the part 6 indentation post here, when written --></p>
<h1 id="consider-using-yyclearin">Consider using
<code>yyclearin</code></h1>
<p>After recovering from a parse error using the <code>error</code>
token, the lookahead token will still be set to whatever it was that
caused the error to happen in the first place.</p>
<p>If for whatever reason you think that attempting to continue the
parse with that token would just screw things up again, you can use the
<code>yyclearin</code> macro<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">In the C++ skeleton, this is available using
<code>yyla.clear()</code> instead.<br />
<br />
</span></span> to clear out the lookahead token, which will cause Bison
to request another token from the lexer.</p>
<p>We’re not currently using this in Sorbet because I’ve replaced most
places where it might have been useful with some even more powerful
techniques (discussed in a future part), but I figured I may as well
mention it. <!-- TODO(jez) Link to part 5 lexer hacks here --></p>
<h1 id="invent-a-special-ast-node-for-errors">Invent a special AST node

<p>Consider this parse error:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre

<p>To handle the error case, we still have the <code>lhs</code> and the
<code>'='</code>, but we don’t have the <code>arg_rhs</code>. The parser
will detect that <code>'end'</code> is not a valid <code>arg_rhs</code>,
and shift the <code>error</code> token for us to recognize:</p>

<p>It’s unclear what to use in place of <code>$3</code>, because

<p>This special AST node allows phases downstream of the parser to
pretend the parse succeeded. In particular, it’s easy to detect where
the syntax error occurred when responding to completion requests (which
is important, because in the above example, the syntax error is also
where the user’s cursor is).</p>
<h1 id="read-the-generated-parsers-source">Read the generated parser’s

<p>To close, I’d like to point out that everything in this post that I
didn’t find in the official docs, I taught myself by browsing the source
code generated by Bison. Despite being generated, it’s actually pretty
well commented, and with a bit of elbow grease you might even be able to
get your IDE to let you use jump to def in it.</p>
<p>Some nice things about browsing the source:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s never out of sync with the version of Bison you’re using
(unlike the official docs, which only track the latest
version).</p></li>
<li><p>You can see exactly what happens and in what order. For example,
reading the source is how I convinced a colleague that no, using
<code>error</code> productions did not mean we would be preventing
errors from being reported. It was faster to read the source than
attempt to find whether the docs mentioned this.</p></li>
<li><p>You can see what fun, undocumented APIs are actually available to
you. For example, the docs talk about <code>yylval</code> and
<code>yylloc</code>, which are supposed to store the semantic value and
location of the lookahead token. But in the C++ skeleton, these things
have been renamed (without documentation) to <code>yyla.value</code> and
<code>yyla.location</code>, respectively.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Reading the generated parser’s source code reinforced my
understanding of Bison’s parsing algorithm and made it easier to debug
when things went wrong.</p>
<p>All this being said, I’ve run into plenty of limitations when
attempting to improve Sorbet’s parser. In the next post, I’ll explain
one such example, why using <code>error</code> tokens alone wasn’t
enough, and how I tweaked Sorbet’s lexer to aid the parser in error
recovery.</p>
