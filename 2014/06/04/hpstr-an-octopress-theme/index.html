<p>In case you didn’t notice, we’re rocking a new theme: <a
href="https://github.com/jez/hpstr-theme">HPSTR for Octopress</a>!
Ported from the <a
href="https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme">theme of the same
name</a> for Jekyll, this theme has a bunch of cool new features that
make the theme easier to use and more customizable.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Before I begin, I have to give a huge shout out to <a
href="https://github.com/mmistakes/">mmistakes</a> for crafting such an
impeccable set of stylesheets and Jekyll templates. I could talk this
theme up all day, but I think that the results speak for themselves.
Even more praiseworthy is that the entire source code is licensed under
the GPL, enabling anyone to take the source and build upon it. And on
that note, I’d like to unveil what <em>I’ve</em> built.</p>
<h1 id="ported-to-octopress">Ported to Octopress</h1>
<p>The theme was originally implemented for a vanilla Jekyll blog.
Personally, I find the automation tools provided by Octopress to be
incredibly helpful, and I didn’t want to give these up to be able to
deploy this theme. As a result, I had to tweak a few things in order to
get it to work with a standard Octopress installation.</p>
<h1 id="less-to-sass">Less to Sass</h1>
<p>The HPSTR theme was originally built using Less to compile its
stylesheets. Octopress uses Sass under Compass instead–a decision which
I love: the rich library of plugins that Compass provides is ridiculous.
Thus, this was the first step of the port.</p>
<p>After a quick Google search I stumbled upon <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14970224/anyone-know-of-a-good-way-to-convert-from-less-to-sass">this
question</a> on Stack Overflow, which surprisingly took care of the vast
majority of the conversion, leveraging mere text replacement. From
there, it was mostly a matter of slugging through the Less docs to find
out what a particular function did, jumping over to the Compass/Sass
docs to find a corresponding mixin, and repeating.</p>
<h1 id="sass-to-compass">Sass to Compass</h1>
<p>I didn’t stop after I had the vanilla Sass working. One of Compass’s
coolest features is that you don’t have to repeat yourself: there are
mixins for seemingly everything, and when there aren’t, there are
3<sup>rd</sup> party plugins. Thus, the next phase of the port was to
see how much of the code I could reduce to compass mixins.</p>
<p>For the most part, this stage affected CSS3 properties which need
vendor prefixes, to include keyframe animations. The keyframe animations
are particularly worthy of a mention because I found a handy plugin
called <a
href="https://github.com/ericam/compass-animation">compass-animation</a>
to take care of them. It works as easily as any other Compass mixin,
from installation to use.</p>
<h1 id="octopress-mannerisms">Octopress Mannerisms</h1>
<p>There are a few things that Octopress users can expect to be
reasonably similar from one deployment to the next, and I wanted to
ensure that as many of the features dually implemented by mmistakes and
Octopress used the syntax or conformed to the style set forth by
Octopress. A small example of this: the <code>page.link</code> and
<code>page.external_url</code> properties. Defined by the old and new
themes respectively, both accomplish a similar purpose. Each specifies
that the main purpose of the post is to link to a different page. Not
wanting to break the service for current Octopress users, I tried to
convert as many of these subtleties.</p>
<p>On top of this, I restructured a lot of the original code so that
someone used to customizing an Octopress theme would feel more at home
when checking out the source for this theme, even if some of the
particulars were different. This applied mostly to the Sass directory
structure, but also to the templates.</p>
<h1 id="more-powerful-customization">More Powerful Customization</h1>
<p>One of the many ways Octopress adds value on top of Jekyll is the
ease with which you can get a Jekyll blog up and running, and
subsequently customize and tweak that theme. This was one area where I
felt that the original Jekyll theme fell short. The original stylesheets
had a somewhat decent set of variables (in
<code>less/variables.less</code>) that would allow you to customize the
colors and font faces, but the method for customizing the size of the
font was wonky (larger values produced smaller fonts), and the various
mixins employed to handle setting the sizes were confusing.</p>
<p>To solve this, I added <em>loads</em> of new variables handling the
font sizes and line heights on a per-component basis, while also
providing a master switch to easily resize everything. My theme also
differs here from the original in that it’s default font size is
slightly larger for normal paragraph text (the whole reason why I cared
about customizing the font size in the first place!).</p>
<h1 id="like-what-you-see">Like what you see?</h1>
<p>This theme is in no way perfect, from the styles to the compatibility
with the vast array of Octopress options. If my support for your
favorite feature is lacking or absent altogether, patch it up and submit
a pull request on <a
href="https://github.com/jez/hpstr-theme">GitHub</a>!</p>
<p><strong>I’d also love to hear about your installation
process.</strong> If something didn’t quite work out right when
installing the theme from GitHub or everything went super smoothly, tell
me on GitHub in an issue, on <a
href="https://www.twitter.com/Z1MM32M4N">Twitter</a>, in the comments
below, or in an <a href="mailto:jake@zimmerman.io">email</a>.
Seriously!</p>
