<p>It’s one thing to plug in a CD, click through a few dialogs, and wait
for the computer to chime at you saying that your printer has been
installed. Unfortunately, this is not how server administration works.
Here’s my account of installing multiple network-attached printers on a
Debian server.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>For those who only care about the solution:
<a href="#tldr">TL;DR</a>.</p>
<h1 id="the-hard-way">The Hard Way</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in my last post, I’m a part of a student organization
called <a href="//www.scottylabs.org">ScottyLabs</a>. We do tons of cool
things, but the project which I’m currently working on is <a
href="//print.scottylabs.org">Print@ScottyLabs</a>. It’s a really handy
service which lets you send an attachment to <a
href="mailto:print@scottylabs.org"
class="uri">mailto:print@scottylabs.org</a> and have it sent to the
printer. I’m currently in the process of rewriting much of the code base
from scratch to support a plethora of highly-requested features, so
there will no doubt be more posts about my exploits.</p>
<p>Luckily, CMU (and arguably every college) is not terribly notable for
keeping up-to-date information on it’s website. This means that I got
the “wonderful” opportunity to dig through CUPS documentation, sketchy
printer manufacturer websites, and the depths of the Internet to finagle
together a solution. Here’s to hoping that you have a far more
pleasurable experience. Without further ado, these are the steps I went
through to get it done.</p>
<h1 id="what-didnt-work">What Didn’t Work</h1>
<p>The Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) is a relatively new standard
which is designed to improve over the rather haphazard methods used for
printing in the past. It improves in a lot of ways and has a few neat
features. One of these is a handy web interface which lets you interact
with your configuration files, add printers, view the print queue, etc.
through a beginner-friendly GUI, which described me perfectly when I
started and still does now.</p>
<p>By default, when <code>cupsd</code> (the CUPS daemon) starts up, it
listens on <code>http://localhost:631</code> incoming HTTP requests. By
default, external requests are refused. You can either enable these in a
configuration file somewhere or <a
href="http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Using_SSH_to_Port_Forward">tunnel your
traffic</a> through an <code>ssh</code> proxy, “tricking” the server
into thinking your requests are coming locally. Additionally, you must
be either <code>root</code> or in the <code>lpadmin</code> group to
access the administration parts of this web GUI.</p>
<p>But for whatever reason, neither using the <code>root</code> username
and password nor adding myself to the <code>lpadmin</code> group worked.
I was incessantly blocked by the interface when I tried to give it my
credentials. Defeated, I needed to find another way.</p>
<p>I’m telling you this as a sort of justification for the super hacky
solution that I came up with (but that works in the end, even if it’s
non-standard). If you have any ideas on why this failed, I’d love to
hear them!</p>
<h1 id="when-in-doubt-duct-tape">When in doubt, duct tape</h1>
<p>The instructions to install CMU print drivers on Linux only work for
environments with desktop environments installed. (You can read these
instructions <a
href="http://www.cmu.edu/computing/clusters/printing/how-to/linux/pers-cluster.html">here</a>).
So, in keeping with the UNIX philosophy that everything’s a file, the
solution I came up with was essentially to follow these instructions on
a <strong>personal Linux box</strong>, then <strong>copy and
modify</strong> the corresponding files to achieve the same effect on
the server we need them to be on.</p>
<p>It’s at this point that you’re probably wondering why I didn’t just
do a little research and figure out how to make these modifications
myself, or perhaps figure out where the files I needed were coming from.
There are a couple of reasons. First, that takes a lot of time, I’m
lazy, and whatever I came up with didn’t need to scale. Second, when you
install a CUPS printer, you need a PostScript Printer Description (PPD)
file to tell CUPS how the printer works. Despite my best efforts
searching the web, I couldn’t find a central repository where these .ppd
files were stored. However, most desktop environments have the ability
to search <strong>somewhere mystical</strong> (read: you should tell me
if you know) and download these .ppd files.</p>
<h1 id="tldr">Do you think I really care, just tell me how it works</h1>
<p>The process is not too complicated. Go back to the <a
href="http://www.cmu.edu/computing/clusters/printing/how-to/linux/pers-cluster.html">CMU
instructions</a> to install a printer on a personal Linux machine.
Following them should be fairly self explanatory. Say perhaps that you
want to install the print drivers for the queue
<code>andrew-color</code>. After following along and inserting
“andrew-color” as the print queue where required, you’ll come up to a
screen that asks you to name your printer. This name does not have to be
the name of the queue, but I always make it that when I’m working with
the CMU printers. Either way, be sure to remember what you entered for
this name (again, I’m using the name “andrew-color”).</p>
<p>Also, part of the process should involve you specifying a PPD file.
The easiest way to do this is to go to a printer that dispatches jobs
from that queue and to get the make and model for it. In the case of
andrew-color, the Wean printer is an HP Color LaserJet CP6015x. Using
this information, we can use the Gnome/KDE/XFCE window, enter our make
and model, and have it spit out the recommended PPD file to use
(although it likely won’t call as such).</p>
<p>Now that everything is all installed, we can pluck the information we
need. If you’re on a standard Linux install, your CUPS files will be in
<code>/etc/cups</code>. The specific files that are of interest to us
are <code>/etc/cups/printers.conf</code> and
<code>/etc/cups/ppd/&lt;your-printer-name&gt;.ppd</code>, so my file is
called <code>/etc/cups/ppd/andrew-color.ppd</code>. We need the entire
.ppd file, and it will go into the corresponding directory on our
server. As for <code>printers.conf</code>, we just need a specific
entry. This file is a list of all the installed printers, each wrapped
in <code>&lt;Printer your-printer-name&gt;&lt;/Printer&gt;</code> tags.
Yank this text however you want from your local computer to the server,
and add it to the corresponding <code>printers.conf</code> file. If your
personal Linux machine made the
<code>&lt;Printer&gt;&lt;/Printer&gt;</code> tags into
<code>&lt;DefaultPrinter x&gt;&lt;/DefaultPrinter&gt;</code> tags, go
ahead and change this to just
<code>&lt;Printer x&gt;&lt;/Printer&gt;</code>. To recap, now I’ve got
about 20 lines of additional configuration data added to the
<code>printers.conf</code> file on my server, beginning with the line
<code>&lt;Printer andrew-color&gt;</code> and ends with the line
<code>&lt;/Printer&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>For my installation, I have one more thing to do. Somewhere in the
middle of this entry, there is a line which reads something like
<code>Filter application/vnd.cups-postscript 0 hpps</code>. CUPS has a
filtering functionality that lets you interact with the data before it
gets printed, which you can read more about <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUPS#Filtering_process">here</a>. We
want to make sure that we use the <code>foomatic</code> filters (because
that’s how our server is configured), so we have to change the existing
filters so that they read</p>
<pre><code>Filter application/vnd.cups-raw 0 -
Filter application/vnd.cups-postscript 100 foomatic-rip
Filter application/vnd.cups-pdf 0 foomatic-rip</code></pre>
<p>After all this, if you’ve copied the PPD file into the right folder
(<code>/etc/cups/ppd/</code>), then you’re all set! Restart CUPS with
<code>sudo /etc/init.d/cups restart</code> so that your changes take
effect. You can print using <code>lp</code> and the <code>-d</code> flag
to specify the print queue you want. Remember that we picked the name
“andrew-color” for our print queue above, so a sample <code>lp</code>
command would look like this:</p>
<p><code>lp -t ‘My First Color Print Job’ -U jezimmer -d andrew-color /path/to/myfile.pdf</code></p>
<p>Happy printing!</p>
