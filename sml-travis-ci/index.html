<main>
<p>For one of my recent projects (<a
href="https://github.com/jez/multi-grep"><code>multi-grep</code></a>) I
went through the work to get Standard ML building in Travis CI. It
turned out to be not too hard—in fact, the hardest part is already done,
and I’m happy to share how it works.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> is a service that lets
a project run arbitrary code when someone commits and pushes a change.
This code can do things like make sure the tests pass, build and publish
releases, and even deploy the code somewhere.</p>
<h1 id="features">Features</h1>
<p>The way I set up my builds for SML with Travis CI, I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>build and test with both macOS and Linux</li>
<li>build and test with both SML/NJ and MLton</li>
<li>create executables, even with SML/NJ</li>
<li>publish the resulting builds to GitHub as releases</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from some scripts to install things on each operating system,
under the hood it’s powered by <a
href="https://github.com/jez/symbol">Symbol</a>, which is a build tool
for Standard ML I wrote which factors out most of the project-agnostic
stuff.</p>
<h1 id="the-core-setup">The core setup</h1>
<p>Rather than paste the code into a snippet here and wait for it to get
out of date, see my <a
href="https://github.com/jez/multi-grep"><code>multi-grep</code></a>
project on GitHub for all the up-to-date files. In total, there are
three files in that repo which set the whole thing up:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a
href="https://github.com/jez/multi-grep/blob/b6a42719b1ffca389556655982e6c4b7fa19c9a1/.travis.yml">.travis.yml</a>
(kicks off the build)</li>
<li><a
href="https://github.com/jez/multi-grep/blob/b6a42719b1ffca389556655982e6c4b7fa19c9a1/Brewfile">Brewfile</a>
(deps for macOS build)</li>
<li><a
href="https://github.com/jez/multi-grep/blob/b6a42719b1ffca389556655982e6c4b7fa19c9a1/tests/travis-install.sh">tests/travis-install.sh</a>
(deps for Linux build)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you haven’t used Travis CI before, you’ll probably also want to
check out the <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/">Travis CI docs</a>
to get a feel for how to actually set things up, and where these pieces
fit in.</p>
<p>After installing the deps on each box (like SML/NJ and MLton) and
running the tests, the command which actually builds the the whole
project is</p>
<pre><code>./symbol install</code></pre>
<p>This command is provided by <a
href="https://github.com/jez/symbol">Symbol</a>, a build tool I wrote
for Standard ML. I talk a little bit more about it in the section
below.</p>
<h1 id="why-write-a-whole-build-tool">Why write a whole build tool?</h1>
<p>I mentioned above that I’d written a build tool for Standard ML,
called <a href="https://github.com/jez/symbol">Symbol</a>. Why? It
started as a shell script + <code>Makefile</code> for <a
href="https://github.com/jez/multi-grep"><code>multi-grep</code></a> and
then I realized that these scripts could be useful in any Standard ML
project.</p>
<p>SML/NJ and MLton are already great compilers with their own build
tools. It’s useful to be able to build a project with both (SML/NJ for
faster builds and a REPL, and MLton for faster compiled executables).
All Symbol really does is put SML/NJ and MLton behind a unified, very
stripped down interface. It doesn’t try to hide that, so that it’s still
possible to fall back to those programs for more complex workflows.</p>
<p>There’s more information <a href="https://github.com/jez/symbol">in
the README</a>, but some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symbol makes it easy to build and install executables, even with
SML/NJ which traditionally uses heap images.</li>
<li>Symbol is built on <code>make</code>, so if <strong>no</strong>
source files change, even recompiling with MLton is instant (e.g.,
changing a test and re-running the tests doesn’t require re-building
everything).</li>
<li>Symbol also supports scaffolding new Standard ML projects, which is
nicer than starting from scratch.</li>
</ul>
<p>The usage looks something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># initialize a new project:</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">❯</span> symbol-new hello</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">❯</span> cd hello</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># build with SML/NJ:</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">❯</span> ./symbol make</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">❯</span> .symbol-work/bin/hello</span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">Hello,</span> world!</span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># or, build with MLton:</span></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">❯</span> ./symbol make with=mlton</span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">❯</span> .symbol-work/bin/hello</span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">Hello,</span> world!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again, there’s way more information <a
href="https://github.com/jez/symbol">in the README</a>, so definitely
check it out if you’re thinking about setting up a new Standard ML
project.</p>
<h1 id="why-standard-ml-in-the-first-place">Why Standard ML in the first
place?</h1>
<p>I’ll probably get around to <a href="/surgery-on-code/">writing about
<code>multi-grep</code></a> (and related tools like
<code>diff-locs</code> and <code>multi-sub</code>) but at the end of the
day: SML is a really pleasant language to use in a lot of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type inference in Standard ML is a breath of fresh air.</li>
<li>Data types let me wonder less about how things work.</li>
<li>Pattern matching makes for concise, clean, and correct code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard ML was my most commonly used programming language throughout
all of my university courses, so there’s a definite soft spot in my
heart for it. There are features that I wish it had sometimes, but it’s
the only language that I’ve used that doesn’t feel fundamentally broken
in some way.</p>
