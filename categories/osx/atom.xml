    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Diehl&rsquo;s article <a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/vim_2016.html">Vim and Haskell in 2016</a> does a great
job of outlining the quickest way to get a quality Haskell development
experience. I ran into a simple issue when I followed it due to a bit of an
idiosyncrasy on OS X El Capitan. I also document a few of the extra steps I took
which aren&rsquo;t mentioned explicitly in his original article.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This post wouldn&rsquo;t actually be necessary if it weren&rsquo;t for one thing: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899">System
Integrity Protection</a> in OS X El Capitan, also known as &ldquo;rootless&rdquo;
mode. It affects Haskell&rsquo;s build and install step in a subtle (but solved) way,
and the rest of the article will cover what to watch out for when installing on
OS X.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t follow these instructions and you&rsquo;re on OS X El Capitan, you&rsquo;ll
likely run into an issue that looks like <code>/usr/bin/ar: permission denied</code>. The
Stack installation instructions call this out specifically:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you are on OS X 10.11 (&ldquo;El Capitan&rdquo;) or later, GHC 7.8.4 is incompatible
with System Integrity Protection (a.k.a. &ldquo;rootless&rdquo;). GHC 7.10.2 includes a
fix, so this only affects users of GHC 7.8.4.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the risk of spoiling the surprise, we&rsquo;re going to set up Stack while taking
care to make sure that we get GHC >= 7.10. So let&rsquo;s do just that!</p>

<h2>Environment Prep (optional)</h2>

<p>Note that this step is optional and has nothing to do with OS X; I just wanted
to point it out quickly.</p>

<p>Under <a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/vim_2016.html#dev-environment">Dev Environment</a> on <a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/vim_2016.html">Vim and Haskell in
2016</a>, Stephen Diehl writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Times have changed quite a bit, and the new preferred way of installing GHC in
2016 is to forgo using the system package manager for installing ghc and use
Stack to manage the path to the compiler executable and sandboxes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stack stores it&rsquo;s metadata in the <code>~/.stack</code> folder by default. If you&rsquo;re not a
huge fan of things cluttering up your home folder, set the <code>STACK_ROOT</code> variable
in you bashrc or zshrc:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Set STACK_ROOT to avoid clutter">export XDG_DATA_HOME="$HOME/.local/share"

# Have Haskell Stack use XDG Base Directory spec
export STACK_ROOT="$XDG_DATA_HOME/stack"
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the choice of location is up to you. In particular I&rsquo;ve chosen to
adhere to the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory_support">XDG Base Directory specification</a> here, which you may want
to take a peek at if you&rsquo;re unfamiliar. That&rsquo;s why you see references to
<code>XDG_DATA_HOME</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure you restart your terminal to pick up the new variables before
continuing.</p>

<h2>Install Stack from Homebrew</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ll want to take a second to purge anything
Haskell-related from previous botched setup attempts:</p>

<pre><code class="bash Wipe the slate clean"># If you had GHC installed
$ brew uninstall ghc

# If you tried and failed at installing Stack already
$ brew uninstall haskell-stack
$ rm -r ~/.stack
# If you happened to also set STACK_ROOT
$ rm -r $STACK_ROOT
</code></pre>

<p>With that out of the way, we can actually get our hands on Stack. For OS X,
we&rsquo;ll install through Homebrew:</p>

<pre><code class="console Install Stack">$ brew install haskell-stack
</code></pre>

<h2>Configure Stack, avoiding &ldquo;rootless&rdquo; issues</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the trick. We need to run <code>stack setup</code> for the first time to let Stack
configure itself. But remember: we want to make sure that Stack doesn&rsquo;t set
itself up with version 7.8.4 of GHC. We can get around this by specifying an
explicit resolver to the <code>stack</code> command (you can find more information on
&ldquo;resolvers&rdquo; elsewhere):</p>

<pre><code class="bash Side-step rootless issue in setup"># Change the resolver to the most up-to-date one. This is a hack to ensure that
# get GHC version &gt; 7.8, because there's an issue with El Capitan's rootless
# mode.
stack --resolver=lts-6.10 setup
</code></pre>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice we use the <code>--resolver=...</code> flag to force Stack to use a specific
resolver. This post will be out of date as soon as it&rsquo;s written, so check
<a href="https://www.stackage.org/snapshots">Stackage</a> to find the latest LTS snapshot.</p>

<h2>Return to Vim and Haskell in 2016</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for the environment setup! Now you&rsquo;ll want to turn your attention to
configuring Vim.</p>

<p>The steps to set up Vim are platform independent, so now that we&rsquo;ve set up Stack
correctly, you can head over to <a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/vim_2016.html">Vim and Haskell in 2016</a> to
finish things out.</p>

    <link href="https://blog.jez.io/sml-dev-setup/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-09T21:06:15-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.jez.io/sml-dev-setup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes right down to it, SML is a pretty great language. It&rsquo;s clear that
extensive thought has gone into its design and implementation. I quite enjoy
programming in SML, due in no small part to my collection of workflow hacks that
make editing and developing with SML responsive and interactive.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We&rsquo;re going to be walking through a couple easy steps you can take to make
developing SML feel more fluid, both in and out of your editor. I have a slight
preference for Vim on OS X, but many of these steps are platform agnostic.</p>

<h2>Installing SML Locally</h2>

<p>While developing SML in a remote environment like the shared Andrew Unix
machines makes it easy to dive right in, working with SML for prolonged periods
of time is best done locally.</p>

<p>On OS X and Ubuntu, the two most popular SML implementations are already
packaged. Take the time to install a version of SML right now. At CMU, we use
<a href="http://smlnj.org/">SML/NJ</a>, which is convenient because it has a REPL that lets you play
around with SML interactively. If you&rsquo;d like to play around with compiling and
distributing programs written in SML, you might want to install <a href="http://www.mlton.org/">MLton</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="bash Install SML from your package manager"># SML/NJ on OS X
brew install smlnj
# -- or --
# MLton on OS X
brew install mlton

# SML/NJ on Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install smlnj
# -- or --
# MLton on Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install mlton
</code></pre>

<p>Feel free to install both if you&rsquo;d like; they&rsquo;ll play nicely with each other and
each offers advantages over the other.</p>

<p>Note for OS X users: if you&rsquo;ve never used <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> before, you&rsquo;ll need
to <a href="http://brew.sh">install it first</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting Comfortable with SML/NJ</h2>

<p>The rest of these steps should apply regardless of whether you&rsquo;re working on SML
locally or remotely.</p>

<p>One thing that I&rsquo;ve seen far too many times from course documentation is that
they tell students to run their code like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>sml</code></li>
<li>Type <code>use "foo.sml";</code> or <code>CM.make "sources.cm";</code> at the REPL</li>
</ol>


<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong; this works, but there&rsquo;s a better way. Being responsible
CLI-citizens, we should always be looking for ways to tab-complete. Let&rsquo;s do
this by changing our workflow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>sml foo.sml</code> or <code>sml -m sources.cm</code></li>
</ol>


<p>Look at that! We&rsquo;ve,</p>

<ul>
<li>dropped a step (having to launch the REPL first), and</li>
<li>introduced tab completion into our workflow (because the shell has filename
completion)</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s the little things, but they add up.</p>

<h2>Enhancing the REPL</h2>

<p>Speaking of the little things, when using the SML REPL, you don&rsquo;t have access to
all the usual command line niceties like command history and access to arrow
keys for editing, let alone Vi-like keybindings. To get started, you&rsquo;ll have to
change how you launch the SML/NJ REPL. In particular, we&rsquo;re going to preface our
commands with <code>rlwrap</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="bash"># instead of this...
$ sml

# use this:
$ rlwrap sml
</code></pre>

<p><code>rlwrap</code> stands for &ldquo;readline wrap.&rdquo; Readline is a library that simply adds to a
REPL program all the features mentioned above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Command history tracking</li>
<li>Line editing with arrow keys</li>
<li>Configurability through the <code>~/.inputrc</code> file

<ul>
<li>We can use this to get fancy features like Vi keybindings</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles/blob/ed8e531eebe43a8aef05fc4cb768157d03408cea/inputrc#L12-L14">these lines</a> of my inputrc, a small part of
my <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles">dotfiles repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Vim</h2>

<p>Programming is so much more enjoyable when you&rsquo;re not fighting your editor. For
me, this means striving to get the most out of Vim. In this section, I&rsquo;ll
outline all the cool tips and tricks I have for developing SML in Vim.</p>

<p>But first, if you&rsquo;ve never taken a look into how to configure Vim, I suggest you
start out by walking through this quick workshop called <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide">Vim as an
IDE</a>. It&rsquo;ll teach you where to start when configuring Vim and get
you set up with a bunch of standard plugins that improve on the standard Vim
experience tenfold.</p>

<p>No actually, take a second and <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide">walk through it</a>. We&rsquo;ll still be
here when you&rsquo;re done, and you&rsquo;ll appreciate Vim more when you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<h3>Syntastic</h3>

<p>From the Syntastic documentation:</p>

<blockquote><p>Syntastic is a syntax checking plugin for Vim that runs files through
external syntax checkers and displays any resulting errors to the user. This
can be done on demand, or automatically as files are saved. If syntax errors
are detected, the user is notified and is happy because they didn&rsquo;t have to
compile their code or execute their script to find them.</p></blockquote>

<p>And the best part? Syntastic ships with a checker for SML by default if you
have SML/NJ installed.</p>

<p>If you didn&rsquo;t just install <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">Syntastic</a> from the Vim as an IDE
walkthrough, you can <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">visit their homepage</a> for installation
instructions. Go ahead and do this now, then try writing this in a file called
<code>test.sml</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="sml test.sml">val foo : string = 42
</code></pre>

<p>You should see an &lsquo;x&rsquo; next to the line and a description of the error from the
type checker. You can imagine how handy this is.</p>

<h3>Extra Syntastic Setup</h3>

<p>Syntastic has their own set of <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic#settings">recommended settings</a> that
you can add at your discretion. At the very least, I&rsquo;d suggest adding these
lines to your vimrc:</p>

<pre><code class="vim .vimrc">...

augroup mySyntastic
  " tell syntastic to always stick any detected errors into the location-list
  au FileType sml let g:syntastic_always_populate_loc_list = 1

  " automatically open and/or close the location-list
  au FileType sml let g:syntastic_auto_loc_list = 1
augroup END

" press &lt;Leader&gt;S (i.e., \S) to not automatically check for errors
nnoremap &lt;Leader&gt;S :SyntasticToggleMode&lt;CR&gt;

...
</code></pre>

<p>By default, whenever you save your file, Syntastic will place symbols in Vim&rsquo;s
<em>sign column</em> next to lines with errors. The first two settings above tell
Syntastic to also show a summarized list of errors at the bottom of the screen.
The final setting lets you press <code>&lt;Leader&gt;S</code> (which is usually just <code>\S</code>) to
disable all that. This is useful when you&rsquo;re still unfinished and you know your
SML isn&rsquo;t going to type check. Press it again to re-enable it.</p>

<p>Also, a tip for those who&rsquo;ve never used Vim&rsquo;s location list feature before: you
can close the list with <code>:lclose</code>.</p>

<h3><code>vim-better-sml</code></h3>

<p>The curious at this point might be wondering if Syntastic is smart enough to
figure out when the file you&rsquo;re using requires a CM file to compile and uses it
to show you where the errors are instead. As it turns out: no, <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic/pull/1719">that&rsquo;s not a
feature Syntastic wants to include</a> by default. However, the
functionality isn&rsquo;t hard to implement, and there&rsquo;s already a plugin for it!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-better-sml">vim-better-sml</a> is one of my Vim plugins. Here&rsquo;s a quick
rundown of its features:</p>

<ul>
<li>As already mentioned, it will detect when your file requires a CM file to
build, and will pass along the information to Syntastic</li>
<li><code>let</code> expressions are indented one level under <code>fun</code> declarations</li>
<li><code>*.sig</code> files are properly detected as SML signature files</li>
<li>Apostrophe characters are treated as keywords characters</li>
<li>The comment string is properly registered for SML files</li>
</ul>


<p>For more information, including how to install it, check out the homepage:
<a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-better-sml">vim-better-sml</a>.</p>

<h2>General Vim Settings</h2>

<p>As a quick addendum, one common complaint people have when editing SML is that
it forces the line to wrap if it extends to 80 characters. Some people don&rsquo;t
like that it does this, and others don&rsquo;t like that it doesn&rsquo;t do it frequently
enough (namely, it only wraps the line if your cursor extends past 80
characters, not the end of the line).</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want Vim to do any of this wrapping, run this:</p>

<pre><code class="vim Disable hard line wrapping">setlocal textwidth=0
</code></pre>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like this change to persist between Vim sessions, add it to
<code>~/.vim/after/ftplugin/sml.vim</code>. These folders and file likely don&rsquo;t exist
yet; you&rsquo;ll have to create them. The <code>after</code> folder in Vim is used to override
settings loaded from plugins. As you might have guessed, files in here are run
after plugin code is.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you&rsquo;d like a little better idea when Vim&rsquo;s going to hard wrap
your line, you can add this line to your vimrc:</p>

<pre><code class="vim Show a color column">set colorcolumn+=0
</code></pre>

<p>Note: this will only work if you&rsquo;re using Vim 7.4 or above. This setting tells
Vim to draw a solid column at the same width as the value of the <code>textwidth</code>
setting.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>We covered a lot, so here&rsquo;s a quick recap:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install SML locally. It&rsquo;s super easy to do on OS X and Linux (use your package
manager), and means you don&rsquo;t have have a Wi-Fi connection to develop SML.</li>
<li>Invest time into learning Vim. Here&rsquo;s a reference: <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide">Vim as an
IDE</a>.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">Syntastic</a>. It tells you what lines your errors are on.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/jez/vim-better-sml">vim-better-sml</a>. It includes some features Syntastic
doesn&rsquo;t by default, and includes a couple extras.</li>
<li>Consider using <code>setlocal textwidth=0</code> or <code>set colorcolumn+=0</code> to deal with the
80-character restriction when writing SML files.</li>
</ul>


<p>And as always, you can see even more Vim settings in my <a href="https://github.com/jez/dotfiles">dotfiles
repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

    <updated>2015-01-10T17:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.jez.io/2015/01/10/offline-latex-development-part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve already written about how I develop LaTeX offline in Vim using GNU Make.
Recently, though, I found a tool that implements another feature that GUI
editors had to themselves: splitting panes.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2><a href="/2014/10/06/offline-latex-development/">Offline LaTeX Development</a></h2>

<p>If you missed it, check out my previous post here before reading on. There&rsquo;s a
lot of handy stuff there!</p>

<h2>Split Panes</h2>

<p>Out of the box, tools like ShareLaTeX and TeXShop feature split pane editing:
you can have your LaTeX on one half of the screen and the PDF on the other.
Previously, I justified not having this feature with the reasoning that the
<code>:WV</code> binding (something I explained <a href="/2014/10/06/offline-latex-development/">here</a>) immediately opened up the
PDF and the windows switched.</p>

<p>However, I read about a tool called <a href="http://ianyh.com/amethyst/">Amethyst</a> on Hacker News the
other day and immediately realized it&rsquo;s potential for improving my LaTeX setup.
Amethyst is a tool that strives to be a tiling window manager like xmonad for OS
X. At times it falls short of this goal, but for the most part it works really
well. Just open up two apps, like MacVim and Preview, and it&rsquo;ll show them
side-by-side with no added effort. There are also plenty of keybindings to
manipulate the window arrangements.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of what the new setup looks like:</p>

<p><a class="image-link" href="/images/latex-amethyst.png"><img src="/images/latex-amethyst.png"></a></p>

<p>After looking into it a little more, it looks like there are other OS X tools
for spitting the screen into two panes, like <a href="http://www.bettertouchtool.net/">BetterTouchTool</a>, though I
haven&rsquo;t actually tried any of them out.</p>
