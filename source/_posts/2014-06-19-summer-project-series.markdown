After spending most of the beginning of the summer flying, driving, moving, moving again, riding trains, riding different trains, and starting a new job, it's finally time to start working on some cool side projects.

## Running a VPS
Inspired in part by the [Computer Club talk](http://www.club.cc.cmu.edu/talks/vps.html) and in part by my inability to do anything quickly on a raspberry pi, I recently decided to rent out a VPS from DigitalOcean. Read on for notes and ramblings about what I'm using it for.

## JavaScript Adventures
Over at ScottyLabs, we're planning some super awesome talks and labs to teach web development during the upcoming semester, so I've been hard at work compiling and writing some awesome JavaScript demos, resources, and projects.

Edit: Web Dev Weeks was a hit! If you had the chance to come to one of the talks, great! We'll be holding similar events later in the year, too. If you didn't make it, here's what you missed:

- [My Frontend Development (JavaScript) workshop](//scottylabs.org/webdevweeks/frontend/)

## Print@ScottyLabs
Okay, so I haven't actually started this one yet, but I will be soon! I'll be rewriting the service from just about the ground up, adding tons of cool features along the way. 

In the mean time, if mail servers, Python 3, and Django are your thing, you may want to check out the following links that I've come across while doing a bit of research.

- __ [Python 3.4.1 and MIME Multipart Messages](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html#whatsnew-email-contentmanager) __
- __ [Django 1.7 to include built-in schema migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.7/) __

Edit: I've started Print 2.0, and it's moving slowly now that classes have started to pick up. I have done a bit of work on it though, and I'll be documenting it soon. Since it's no longer the summer, though, it won't be published under the Summer Project Series tag.
